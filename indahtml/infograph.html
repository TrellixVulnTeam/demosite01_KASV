I work my ass for a living as a truck driver, day-trader, full-stack developer, and security. I would like to transfer over from trucking and security to day-trading and full-stack developer. I figure that way, I won't have to keep putting myself in harms way to make an earning all the time.

After working for so long as driver and security, I found I'm am straying further away from what I intended to do with my life. which is relax get my personal projects going before I reach my incapable age limit. 

I day trade from 0500 pst to 1300 pst during the week. more or less depending on the trade situation. I resume writing codes from 1800 pst to 0200 pst. depending on what occurs at that time. you can leave detail email message or text and I'll get started on the situation right away.
